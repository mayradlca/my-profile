				<p class="text-center"> 
				Not much to say, but just go check my spotify account! Enjoy some of the playlist I got for every single ocassion, you may find a bit too much of Taylor Swift or Harry Styles, but nothing to worry about. If you have more suggestions don't mind reaching out to me on social media, I love hearing new songs and atrists!

				<h2 class="text-center"> About travelling </h2>
				<p class="text-center"> 
				Through volunteering, family trips and different courses I have been able to travel and experience different cultures, here are my personal favorites!
				</p>
				<ol class="countries">
					<li>Mexico</li>
					<p>Either family or friends, immerse yourself in the beautiful beaches in Tulum, Cancun or Cozumel, the stunning hikes in the forest area or into the historical Maya Culture and its pyramids around the country! Be aware of safety issues, travel wisely and research with time.</p>
					<li>Spain</li>
					<p>If you are travelling with friends this is the plan, from San Sebastian to Sevilla going through Madrid or Barcelona, Spain is the place you must vist! Enjoy the beaches, parties, amazing food and landscapes while travelling safely and learning about what this country can offer.</p>
					<li>Thailand</li>
					<p>I could visit this country a hundred times more, this country can offer you everything you need and even more, added to the landscape, food and culture the holistic view thai people bring to you can give a different sense of perspective and allow you to think out of the box, Chiang-Mai, Phuket and Krabi are some of the must go cities</p>
